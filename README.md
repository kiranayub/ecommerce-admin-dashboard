#  Project Documentation â€“ Kiran E-commerce Admin Dashboard
   https://kiranecommerceadmindashboard.netlify.app/

##  Overview

This admin dashboard was built with **Vue.js** for front-end interactivity and **AG Grid** for data table capability. **Node.js** was employed to mimic API interactions without actual database integration, as backend/database integration wasn't explicitly needed in the initial brief.

---

##  Design Decisions

- **Component-Based Architecture (Vue.js)**: Maintainable and reusable UI.

- **AG Grid**: Efficient and robust for handling inventory data with capabilities such as sorting, filtering, and updating stock.
- **Mock Backend with Node.js**: Direct product addition and inventory logic simulation without DB.
- **Color Indicators**: Products low in stock are marked in **red** to attract admin attention.
- **Chart Visualization**: Revenue is represented through simple and clean bar/pie charts for business understanding.

## Challenges Faced

| Challenge | Solution |

|----------|----------|
| Backend not clearly defined | Used Node.js to simulate backend behavior with static/mock data |
| Managing tabular data | Implemented AG Grid with built-in filtering & sorting |
| Form data management | Used Vue's reactive system for form submission & validation |
| Visual indications for low stock | Utilized conditional styling within AG Grid to mark low stock rows |
